      <p>I started working for Ximplia through a final internship of the
        programmer course I attended. During this experience, I specialized
        in Laravel, PHP, requirements analysis and code optimization. I
        developed the ability to work in a team, adopting Agile methodologies.</p>

      <div class="subheading mb-3">IFOA Training Institute of Corporate Professionals</div>
      <p>I took a sabbatical for a year to switch careers and focus on learning to program.
        I took intensive courses, starting from scratch and acquired programming skills
        in languages and frameworks. This helped me transition successfully into a
        career in the informatic field, where I now apply my skills and aim to increase my knowledge.</p>
